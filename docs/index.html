                  Once the XML data has been retrieved from the Web service,
                  the question remains: How can the Web service consumer present the data
                  in a meaningful way to the end-user?  While simply viewing the XML document
                  provides all of the necessary information regarding database health, it
                  is impractical for the user to look for specific health alerts in this
                  manner.  Therefore, self-contained Web-based graphical components, or
                  <i>widgets</i> were created in order to present the data in a logical and
                  accessible way.

            <h1 class="head2green">Why use JavaScript?</h1>
            <p>
              While many alternatives existed to creating widgets, JavaScript utimately
              proved to be the best language for the task.  Straight HTML and CSS were not
              used because each widget would have to be created by copying and
              pasting code wherever one was required.  For example, if multiple dialog boxes
              were required, the dialog box HTML code would have to be duplicated in order to obtain
              two dialog boxes.  This is inefficient and usually results in programmer error
              by having HTML elements with a duplicate ID or name property.

              <br /><br />
              Another viable alternative would be to use PHP modules to write the HTML and CSS
              as described above.  This would allow for reusability since each module would
              act as a widget creation function (for example, if a dialog box was required,
              pass the data to the dialog creation script and have it output the necessary
              HTML and CSS).  However, problems exist in the method of passing the data
              to the desired PHP script (that is, via HTTP POST, XMLHTTP, and files), and
              updating each of the widgets separately from the page.  While it is possible to
              do, most likely, it would involve writing some JavaScript, HTML, and CSS from
              PHP, or writing HTML and CSS in PHP while using JavaScript functions to handle
              events from the pre-written HTML.  Both situations cause the presentation layer
              to be split, which can result in code maintenance and debugging issues.

              <br /><br />
              Because JavaScript is an object-oriented language, all of the widgets have been
              designed as such.  Because these widgets are Web-based they ultimately
              break down into HTML and CSS.  However, the JavaScript solution is entirely
              object-oriented, including the way in which the HTML is generated (that is, using
              HTML DOM).  While specific CSS styles are required in order to generate the
              look-and-feel of each widget, the majority of the style information
              can be preserved in external stylesheets.  In this manner, an even greater
              degree of presentation layer separation is achieved.
            </p>

            <h1 class="head2green">Widget Structure</h1>
            <p>
              All widgets are designed as resuable objects with each possessing a set of methods for
              which to prepare the look-and-feel and to perform updates.

              <br /><br />
              While in other object-oriented languages specific methods
              might exist to adjust each aspect of the widget's look-and-feel,
              this is a Web-based environment. Instead, each widget contain methods
              for specifying the name of the CSS classes (defined in external or internal
              stylesheets) from which the style can be determined as a whole.

              <br /><br />
              The key to understanding the widgets is to realize that the JavaScript is
              building a set of HTML tags in a specific order, applying stylesheet information,
              and embedding the desired events in an object-oriented manner.  Taking this
              a step further, after a widget is rebuilt with different content, all the JavaScript
              does is rebuild the underlying HTML tags using HTML DOM, reapply the desired CSS,
              and reattach the necessary events for user interaction.
            </p>

            <h1 class="head2green">Widget Documentation Structure</h1>
            <p>
              To make the widget usage process simple, each widget has its own documentation
              page which can be viewed from the links below.  The structure of this documentation
              takes a step-by-step approach to providing an in-depth understanding of the
              specified widget.  The documentation is structured as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Introduction</li>
              <li>Look and Feel</li>
              <li>Dependencies</li>
              <li>HTML Structure</li>
              <li>Class Diagram</li>
              <li>Class Documentation</li>
              <li>Example Usage</li>
              <li>Special Notes</li>
              <li>Lessons Learned</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <b>Introduction -</b> Provides an overview as to the motivation behind the creation
              of the widget and how it should be used.

              <br /><br />
              <b>Look and Feel -</b> Provides a sample diagram of what the widget could look like
              when rendered as HTML.  This only applies to widgets that have
              a form of visual presentation (for example, a SortableTable).

              <br /><br />
              <b>Dependencies -</b> Defines all the requirements for using this particular widget
              within an HTML document.  There are three sections: <br />
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Logical Diagram - Visually shows any other widgets that are used internally to construct this widget.</li>
              <li>Include Mechanism - Demonstrates how to include the JavaScript class in an HTML document.</li>
              <li>Browser Compatibility - Shows the browsers in which the widgets were tested and will render as intended.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              <b>HTML Structure -</b> Shows how the widget renders as a set of HTML tags.

              <br /><br />
              <b>Class Diagram -</b> Provides a listing of all available class attributes and methods, including
              the types of required parameters, return values, and their respective scopes. Each attribute
              and method in this diagram is a hyperlink to the appropriate section defined in the class
              documentation section described below.

              <br /><br />
              <b>Class Documentation -</b> Provides a detailed description of the purpose regarding each attribute and method.
              This section is divided into two sections: attibutes and methods.

              <br /><br />
              <b>Example Usage -</b> Provides a set of examples to demonstrate the necessary steps for using a widget
              correctly.  This includes examples of how to include, create, customize, update, destroy, and tie the widget
              back to the HTML document.  Each example builds directly on those before it, thereby providing a
              step-by-step approach to widget creation.

              <br /><br />
              <b>Special Notes -</b> Provides a list of tasks to remember when using a specific widget.

              <br /><br />
              <b>Lessons Learned -</b> Provides an overview as to some of the difficulties that arose when creating
              the widget.
