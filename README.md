ROJO AJAX Toolkit
=================
This is a custom-built, cross-browser AJAX toolkit that I developed while 
working at IBM in 2007 as part of the DB2 Health Monitor Sample
application bundled with the publicly released DB2 Starter Toolkit for PHP. 
 
ROJO was one of the very first AJAX toolkits that was developed and released at a 
time when almost no commerical frameworks were available, or were still in their
infancy (e.g. dojo).


Disclaimer
-------------
Since this toolkit was released in 2007, although it is cross-browser, 
it has not been tested with mobile browsers.  
However, many of the object-oriented and event bubbling techniques presented 
still stand the test-of-time.

Furthermore, since the DB2 Starter Toolkit for PHP has been removed from IBM 
AlphaWorks, I have extracted this framework so that others may benefit from
its distribution.
